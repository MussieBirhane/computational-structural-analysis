# computational-structural-analysis

This repository contains FORTRAN based code for 2D frame and Isoperimetric
(ISOP4) Finite Element (FE) analysis program.

The analysis script are the foundational building blocks for advanced FE
software that analyses a complex 2D beam frame elements and ISOP4 elements.
